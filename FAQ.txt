What is a FLO?

Freshman Leadership Organizations (FLOs) are unique to Texas A&M. These organizations allow first year Aggies to jump into college life and participate in social and service opportunities in order to grow as leaders and in their Aggie spirit. Aggie Fish Club is proud to be a member of the Freshman Leadership Advisory Council (FLAC) where we have joined together with 15 other Freshman Leadership Organizations on campus and vowed to remain unified in the common goal of freshmen leadership. Since we believe that we all have interchangeable experiences, you can only be in one of the 15 FLAC member organizations (ALOT, AFC, LIFE, FLIP, FLIC, FISH, FAST, PREP, FLARE, FLI, FLE, Fish Council, ASSIST FORME, and Fish Aides.) We HIGHLY recommend that you apply for more than one FLO because the competition is very tough, and there are no guarantees. All of us have many commonalities, but we each approach freshmen leadership in our own ways.

What makes AFC different than other FLOs?

* Independently Operated- AFC is housed under the Student Activities department at Texas A&M. This position allows us to be very much in control of the actions and direction of our organization. Many groups report back to a large chain of command, hindering the decisions of the membership. We greatly appreciate our position in the university, because it allows the 6 directors to oversee all of the activities.

     * Complete Control to Freshmen-  Although AFC is directed by a staff of 20 upper-classmen, we have taken the philosophy of chain command and turned it upside down. You, the freshmen, are the ones that shape the year. People comment about how every year AFC is different, and it's because there is a different group of people. There are several projects we believe are essential to leadership development that stay year after year, but besides that, all projects are freshman-initiated, freshman-organized, and freshmen-led, adding even more to your personal sense of accomplishment.

     * No Specific Mold-  AFC truly has no mold when it comes to its members.  Aggies with different majors, beliefs, and backgrounds, all come together and build a family-like environment and strong relationships.  To be in AFC, you are not subjected to a specific level of criteria. All we require is that you be a freshman at Texas A&M University. One of the most exciting parts of our organization is that you get to interact with people that you never would have considered talking to in high school, but your common bond now is that your both Aggies, and you are both willing to grow and develop as a person throughout the year. It's not an issue to us whether you are on- or off-campus, or if you have ever been involved in leadership roles before.

     * Highly Dedicated Former Members- The largest statement of how much our organization works is by seeing how much it means to our former members, or "Ol' Army AFC". Every year we have a reunion, bringing back all members of AFC, all the way back to the class of 1992. They will all tell you that it has changed their life. Friends that they met here became their roommates and at times their husband or wife! The leadership they gained not only applied to other organizations on campus but also out in the real world!
*Substance Policy - AFC’s substance policy states that no two members can use or be in the presence of alcohol or illegal substances at the same time.  The AFC policy eliminates the risk of cliques forming between drinkers and non-drinkers and promotes genuine and meaningful relationships and memories throughout the course of the eventful year in AFC. 

What kind of committees do you have?

Committees in AFC handle a specific area of the operation of the organization for the whole year. But through these times of working together, you gain valuable leadership skills by creating projects that are entirely your own. Our committees include Fundraising, Public Relations, Service, Special Activities, Old Army Relations, Development and Outreach, and Internal Affairs. These groups usually meet once a week outside of the AFC general meeting, and hang out many times during the week and go on a road trip. Please see our Committees page to learn more about the individual committees. 

What in the world are buddy huddles?

Basically these are our social groups within AFC. There are all kinds of activities that all of AFC participates in, but this gives you time to focus on a smaller group. Led by two counselors, each buddy huddle is comprised of eight freshmen and represented by a color. The main goal of these groups is just to have a great time. Activities range from sightseeing in and outside of Bryan/College Station, road trips to the hot spots around Texas, or even just something as simple as a weekly dinner. But the best thing is that it gives you a small group of friends to turn to whenever you need anything.

How much does AFC cost?

Dues for AFC are $85 a semester.  Every penny of that money comes back to you in some way through T-shirts, retreats or other events.  

What is the time commitment?

AFC has two mandatory meetings every week.  One is the AFC meeting, which is at 7:45 on Wednesday nights. The other meeting is your committee meeting which is either on Sunday or Monday night depending on what works for you and the rest of your committee.  Other than those two meetings, AFC’s time commitment is completely up to you.  AFC has many events and hang-outs planned every week, but you do not have to go to everything to still have an amazing year in AFC.

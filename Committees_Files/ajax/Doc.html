            DOC spends all year planning the Gateway Conference which brings in high school students from underdeveloped areas to give them a taste for Texas A&M and teach them that college is a possible goal for anyone. The DOC freshmen have to recruit high schools to send their students and find speakers for the conference in advance. Then at Gateway, the freshmen are in charge. They take the students on a campus tour, to lunch and Sbisa and make sure everything runs smoothly.  Throughout the rest of the year, DOC is the face of AFC.  They go throughout the FLO community to make announcements to other organizations and present a strong image for AFC and the events that we put on. DOC ON!!

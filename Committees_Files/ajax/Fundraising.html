          In this awesome committee, freshmen work alongside each other on a quest to gain sponsorship and collect donations from local businesses 
            to benefit our great philanthropies, Phoebe's Home and New Horizons. Phoebe's Home is a 24-hour emergency shelter for victims of domestic 
            violence, and New Horizons is a home for abused and neglected children.  AFC is proud to say that every single dollar we raise at a 
            Fundraising event goes towards these amazing organizations. Events such as profit shares, post-game Reed Arena clean-ups and bake sales 
            are led and organized by Fundraising.  Most importantly the Annual AFC Gold Tournament is completely run by the Fundraising freshman and 
            is always a blast. GET MONEY!!!

            PR keeps AFC lookin' fresh! This includes all of the brilliant minds that are behind all apparel that is AFC. From Frockets to Snap Backs, 
            Fleeces to Sweat Pants, PR makes sure that everyone on campus knows that you're in the best FLO on campus. PR is constantly working to 
            put out the next AFC fashion statement on to the runway that is Aggieland. If you are into art, design, and fashion or even if you just
             want a lot of say in what AFC looks like, then PR is the committee for you. It's Practically PRfect in everyway!

       Every week, CIA runs the show at weekly meetings.  They organize announcements from other FLOs, committee and director announcements, and introduce the guest speakers. In the fall, CIA plans the amazing Leadership Retreat, a weekend of bonding, growth, and memories.   In the spring semester, CIA plans Parents Weekend, which is a day when the parents and families are given a small taste of the unbelievable year their freshmen have experienced. There are many important responsibilities as well as opportunities for the freshmen to experience leadership as individuals and teamwork as a committee. Overall, CIA will fulfill all of your dreams.

            SAC stands for Special Activities Committee, meaning we basically plan most of the fun events that AFC puts on throughout the year, NBD. 
            Being in SAC will give you a great opportunity to be really hands on in the social aspect of AFC as well as provide a chance to be really 
            creative! One of the best parts about being in SAC is that you get to really bond with all of your committee members through planning all 
            kinds of fun events such as holiday parties, lunch buddies, sporting event ticket pulls and more. SAC is also solely responsible for AFC's 
            Spring Semester Retreat, one of the most exciting weekends throughout the year. By catering to great ideas and having a lot of fun, you also
             get to develop great relationships with the rest of the AFC members because you pretty much run the show and get to really put your new 
            leadership skills into action! SAFE SACS!

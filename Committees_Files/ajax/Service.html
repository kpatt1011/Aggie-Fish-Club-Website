            Service is the committee for those who love giving back. It embodies one of the most important values here at Texas A&M University, selflessness.
             Service is in charge of one of AFC's biggest events, Project Fish. Project Fish is a freshman service day, where fish from all over 
            campus come together to help out the Bryan/College Station Community. By organizing charitable opportunities such as visiting the 
            local juvenile detention center, cleaning up Lake Bryan, and other events for Project Fish, this group creates a sense of caring 
            and compassion within AFC.  Service also consistently provides opportunities throughout the year such as weekly visits to Twin City 
            Missions, the Bryan Animal Shelter, and the Millican House retirement home. Later on in the year, the committee will be responsible 
            for a trip to New Horizons, one of AFC's philanthropies. If you love helping others, then there's only one thing to do: GIVE LOVE. 
            GET SLERVICED.

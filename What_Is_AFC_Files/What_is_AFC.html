     <b>Aggie Fish Club</b> is an organization dedicated to the  
involvement of freshman at Texas A&M University. Through  
weekly meetings, influential speakers, committee projects,  
Buddy Huddle activities and leadership retreats, the  
freshman are provided opportunities to grow as individuals,  
students, and Aggie Leaders. Aggie Fish club serves as a  
support system to the freshman and encourages development  
through positive reinforcement, mentors, and friendship. AFC  
also focuses on the importance of Texas A&M's history and  
tradition, while giving the freshman the opportunity to  
experience the Aggie spirit.

	<h3><a href="#"><p style="font-size:medium;">How is your organization structured?</p></a></h3>
	<div style="white-space:normal;">
		<p style="font-size:small;">
            AFC is comprised of 56 freshmen, 14 sophomore counselors, 3  
            junior directors, and 2 senior directors. All of the staff  
            were freshman in AFC at one point. Throughout the year we do  
            many, many things together as a group, allowing you to get  
            to know everyone in the organization. To break it down into  
            a smaller scale, we also have committees and buddy huddles.  
            Each of these consist of two counselors and eight freshmen
		</p>
	</div>

	<h3><a href="#"><p style="font-size:medium;">What kind of committees do you have?</p></a></h3>
	<div style="white-space:normal;">
		<p style="font-size:small;">
		Committees in AFC handle a specific area of the operation of  
        the organization for the whole year. But through these times  
        of working together, you gain valuable leadership skills by  
        creating projects that are entirely your own. Our committees  
        include Fundraising, Public Relations, Service, Special  
        Activities, Archives, Development and Outreach, and Internal  
        Affairs. These groups usually meet once a week outside of  
        the AFC general meeting, and hang out many times during the  
        week and go on a road trip.
		</p>
	</div>

	<h3><a href="#"><p style="font-size:medium;">What in the world are "Buddy Huddles"?</p></a></h3>
	<div style="white-space:normal;">
		<p style="font-size:small;">
		Basically these are our social groups within AFC. There are  
    all kinds of activities that all of AFC participates in, but  
    this gives you time to focus on a smaller group. Led by two  
    counselors, each buddy huddle is comprised of eight freshmen  
    and represented by a color. The main goal of these groups is  
    just to have a great time. Activities range from sightseeing  
    in and outside of Bryan/College Station, road trips to the  
    hot spots around Texas, or even just something as simple as  
    a weekly dinner. But the best thing is that it gives you a  
    small group of friends to turn to whenever you need  
    anything.

	<h3><a href="#"><p style="font-size:medium;">Why should I pick AFC as my first choice over the other FLOs?</p></a></h3>
	<div>
		<p style="font-size:small; white-space:normal;">
    Aggie Fish Club is proud to be a member of the Freshman  
    Leadership Advisory Council (FLAC) where we have joined  
    together with 14 other Freshman Leadership Organizations  
    (FLOs) on campus and vowed to remain unified in the common  
    goal of freshmen leadership. Since we believe that we all  
    have interchangeable experiences, you can only be in one of  
    the 14 FLAC member organizations (ALOT, AFC, LIFE, FLIP,  
    FLIC, FISH, FAST, PREP, FLARE, FLI, FLE, Fish Council,  
    ASSIST, and Fish Aides.) We HIGHLY recommend that you apply  
    for more than one FLO because the competition is very tough,  
    and there are no guarantees. At your interview you will be  
    asked to place a ballot ranking your choices. All of us have  
    many commonalities, but we each approach freshmen leadership  
    in our own ways.

        <ul>
			<li>
            <p style="font-size:small; white-space:normal;">
            Independently Operated: AFC is housed under the Student  
                Activities department at Texas A&M. This position allows us to  
                be very much in control of the actions and direction of our  
                organization. Many groups report back to a large chain of  
                command, hindering the decisions of the membership. We  
                greatly appreciate our position in the university, because it  
                allows the 5 directors to oversee all of the activities. 
                </p>
             </li>

			<li>
                <p style="font-size:small; white-space:normal;">
            Complete Control to Freshmen: Although AFC is directed by a staff of 19 upper-classmen, we have taken the philosophy  
                of chain command and turned it upside down. You, the  
                freshmen, are the ones that shape the year. People comment  
                about how every year AFC is different, and it's because  
                there is a different group of people. There are several  
                projects we believe are essential to leadership development  
                that stay year after year, but besides that, all projects  
                are freshman-initiated, freshman-organized, and freshmen-led,  
                adding even more to your personal sense of accomplishment.
                </p>
             </li>

			<li>
            <p style="font-size:small; white-space:normal;">
                  No Specific Mold: To be in AFC, you are not subjected to a  
                specific level of criteria. All we require is that you be a  
                freshman at Texas A&M University. One of the most exciting  
                parts of our organization is that you get to interact with  
                people that you never would have considered talking to in  
                high school, but your common bond now is that your both  
                Aggies, and you are both willing to grow and develop as a  
                person throughout the year. It's not an issue to us whether  
                you are on- or off-campus, or if you have ever been involved  
                in leadership roles before.
            </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p style="font-size:small; white-space:normal;">

                Experience Leadership In Multiple Areas: AFC doesn't center its vision on one particular area on campus, but we  
                choose to lead in various areas. We feel that as a freshman,  
                it is more advantageous to investigate multiple  
                organizations on campus rather than tying yourself to one  
                specific branch. You may not be sure of what groups you  
                would like to pursue after your freshman year, so AFC helps  
                you gain valuable skills that can be applied to any group on  
                campus, while at the same time bringing in representatives  
                from all of these organizations to tell you more about what  
                they do.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
            <p style="font-size:small; white-space:normal;">
                Highly Dedicated Former Members: The largest statement of  
                how much our organization works is by seeing how much it  
                means to our former members, or "Ol' Army AFC". Every year  
                we have a reunion, bringing back all members of AFC, all the  
                way back to the class of 1992. They will all tell you that  
                it has changed their life. Friends that they met here became  
                their roommates and at times their husband or wife! The  
                leadership they gained not only applied to other  
                organizations on campus but also out in the real world!
                </p>

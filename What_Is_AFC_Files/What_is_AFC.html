     <b>Aggie Fish Club</b> is an organization dedicated to the  
involvement of freshman at Texas A&M University. Through  
weekly meetings, influential speakers, committee projects,  
Buddy Huddle activities and leadership retreats, the  
freshman are provided opportunities to grow as individuals,  
students, and Aggie Leaders. Aggie Fish club serves as a  
support system to the freshman and encourages development  
through positive reinforcement, mentors, and friendship. AFC  
also focuses on the importance of Texas A&M's history and  
tradition, while giving the freshman the opportunity to  
experience the Aggie spirit.

    <h3><a href="#"><p style="font-size:medium;">What is a FLO?</p></a></h3>
	<div style="white-space:normal;">
		<p style="font-size:small;">
	    
           Freshman Leadership Organizations (FLOs) are unique to Texas A&M. These organizations allow first year Aggies to jump into college life 
            and participate in social and service opportunities in order to grow as leaders and embrace the Aggie spirit. Aggie Fish Club is proud to 
            be a member of the Freshman Leadership Advisory Council (FLAC) where we have joined together with 15 other Freshman Leadership Organizations 
            on campus and vowed to remain unified in the common goal of freshmen leadership. You can only be in one of the 15 FLAC member organizations (ALOT, AFC, LIFE, FLIP, FLIC, FISH, FAST, PREP, FLARE, FLI, FLE, Fish Council, 
            ASSIST FORME, and Fish Aides.) We HIGHLY recommend that you apply for more than one FLO because the competition is very tough, and there are 
            no guarantees. All of us have many commonalities, but we each approach freshmen leadership in our own ways.

	<h3><a href="#"><p style="font-size:medium;">How is your organization structured?</p></a></h3>
	<div style="white-space:normal;">
		<p style="font-size:small;">
            AFC is comprised of 56 freshmen, 14 sophomore counselors, 3  
            junior directors, and 3 senior directors. Everyone on staff   
            was once a freshman in AFC. Throughout the year we do  
            many, many things together as a group, allowing you to get  
            to know everyone in the organization. To break it down into  
            a smaller scale, we also have committees and buddy huddles.  
            Each of these consist of two counselors and eight freshmen
		</p>
	</div>

	<h3><a href="#"><p style="font-size:medium;">What kind of committees do you have?</p></a></h3>
	<div style="white-space:normal;">
		<p style="font-size:small;">
		Each committee in AFC handles a specific area of the organization for the whole year. 
            Through these committees, you gain valuable leadership skills by creating projects that are entirely your own. 
            Our committees include Fundraising, Public Relations, Service, Special Activities, Ol' Army Relations, Development and Outreach, and 
            Internal Affairs. These groups meet once a week, plan several events, and help other committees when needed. Also, they often have hangouts during the week, and go on a road trip. Please see our Committees page to learn more about the individual committees. 
		</p>
	</div>

	<h3><a href="#"><p style="font-size:medium;">What in the world are "Buddy Huddles"?</p></a></h3>
	<div style="white-space:normal;">
		<p style="font-size:small;">
	Basically these are our social groups within AFC. There are all kinds of activities that all of AFC participates in, but Buddy Huddles allows you to 
            focus on a smaller group. Led by two counselors, each buddy huddle is comprised of eight freshmen and represented by a color. The main goal 
            of these groups is just to have a great time. Activities range from sightseeing in and outside of Bryan/College Station, road trips to the 
            hot spots around Texas, or even just something as simple as a weekly dinner. But the best thing is that it gives you a small group of friends 
            to turn to whenever you need anything.

	<h3><a href="#"><p style="font-size:medium;">What makes AFC different than other FLOs?</p></a></h3>
	<div>
    </p>

        <ul>
			<li>
            <p style="font-size:small; white-space:normal;">
          Independently Operated- AFC is housed under the Student Activities department at Texas A&M. This position 
                allows us to be very much in control of the actions and direction of our organization. Many groups report
                 back to a large chain of command, hindering the decisions of the membership. We greatly appreciate our 
                position in the university, because it allows the 6 directors to oversee all of the activities.
                </p>
             </li>

			<li>
                <p style="font-size:small; white-space:normal;">
        Complete Control to Freshmen-  Although AFC is directed by a staff of 20 upper-classmen, we have taken the philosophy of chain 
                    command and turned it upside down. You, the freshmen, are the ones that shape the year. People comment about how 
                    every year AFC is different, and it's because there is a different group of people. There are several projects we 
                    believe are essential to leadership development that stay year after year, but besides that, all projects are freshman-initiated, 
                </p>
             </li>

			<li>
            <p style="font-size:small; white-space:normal;">
                 No Specific Mold-  AFC truly has no mold when it comes to its members.  Aggies with different majors, beliefs, and backgrounds,
                 all come together and build a family-like environment and strong relationships.  To be in AFC, you are not subjected to a specific 
                level of criteria. All we require is that you be a freshman at Texas A&M University. One of the most exciting parts of our organization
                 is that you get to interact with people that you never would have considered talking to in high school, but your common bond now is that 
                your both Aggies, and you are both willing to grow and develop as a person throughout the year. It's not an issue to us whether you are 
                on- or off-campus, or if you have ever been involved in leadership roles before.

            </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p style="font-size:small; white-space:normal;">

               Highly Dedicated Former Members- The largest statement of how much our organization works is by seeing how much it means to our 
                    former members, or "Ol' Army AFC". Every year we have a reunion, bringing back all members of AFC, all the way back to the class 
                    of 1992. They will all tell you that it has changed their life. Friends that they met here became their roommates and at times their
                     husband or wife! The leadership they gained not only applied to other organizations on campus but also out in the real world!
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p style="font-size:small; white-space:normal;">

            Substance Policy - AFCâ€™s substance policy states that no two members can use or be in the presence of alcohol or illegal substances at the 
                    same time.  The AFC policy eliminates the risk of cliques forming between drinkers and non-drinkers and promotes genuine and 
                    meaningful relationships and memories throughout the course of the eventful year in AFC. 
                
                </p>
            </li>

		</ul>
        	
	</div>

    <h3><a href="#"><p style="font-size:medium;">How much does AFC cost?</p></a></h3>
	<div style="white-space:normal;">
		<p style="font-size:small;">
	    
            Dues for AFC are $85 a semester.  Every penny of that money comes back to you in some way through T-shirts, retreats or other events. 

		</p>
		
	</div>

    <h3><a href="#"><p style="font-size:medium;">What is the time commitment?</p></a></h3>
	<div style="white-space:normal;">
		<p style="font-size:small;">
	    
           AFC has two mandatory meetings every week.  One is the AFC meeting, which is at 7:45 on Wednesday nights. The other meeting
            is your committee meeting which is either on Sunday or Monday night depending on what works for you and the rest of your committee. 
             Other than those two meetings, AFC's time commitment is completely up to you.  AFC has many events and hang-outs planned every week, 
            but you do not have to go to everything to still have an amazing year in AFC.

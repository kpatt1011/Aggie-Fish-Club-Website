<span style="font-style:oblique; color:#bcb702;"><b>Aggie Fish Club</b></span> is an organization that takes the dreams of 
individuals and makes them realities. The relationships that  
are developed are full of love and understanding, the Aggie  
way, and the motivational speakers give members a feeling of  
self-importance.<br /><br />

<font style="font-size:14pt; font-style:oblique;"><b>All of this began as a vision.</b></font><br /><br />

As a freshman in Fish Camp '88, future founder of AFC, Jason  
Scott '92, and future student body president Steve Beller  
'92, met in a DG and became great friends by the first day.  
They realized they shared common interests and were excited  
for this new adventure here at Texas A&M. Both were fish in  
the Corps and were two of many freshman who became moved by  
the Aggie Spirit. Fish Camp changed these two young men and  
motivated them to get really involved at Texas A&M.<br /><br />
When they came back to campus, they were longing for the  
atmosphere that Fish Camp had provided.They wanted to  experience what other freshman were experiencing. At the  
time, there were only two leadership organizations on  
campus; Student Government had Fish Aides and the MSC had  
Freshman Leadership Dynamics. The latter organization was  
not very strong and was falling apart. In 1990, Jason,  
Steve, Steven Matthews '93, and Casey Motl '93 took it upon  
themselves to revamp this Freshman Leadership Organization  

in the MSC and renamed it Aggie Leaders of Tomorrow (ALOT).  
Jason was the director of ALOT for two years, and Casey was  
the assistant director. This was a huge learning process  
because the vision of ALOT for Jason, Steve, Steven, and  
Casey did not coincide with the MSC's vision. Frustrated,  
Jason left the organization for a few months, and Casey took  
control. After his break from ALOT, Jason realized he had  
burned out and felt he could not contribute anything more to  
the MSC-run organization.

<br /><br />
The spark of AFC emerged in 1988 while Jason Scott was at  
Fish Camp; the idea was pushed forward in 1990 with the  
revival of ALOT; the dream became a reality in the summer of  
1992.<br /><br />

Jason and the others felt the freshmen at A&M were seriosuly  
missing out on opportunities to get involved. Why couldn't  
the Fish Camp atmosphere last nine months? In 1992, these  
men went to Student Activities, wrote a constitution, and  
started Aggie Fish Club. It was a FLO where they could  
inspire and create. Aggie Fish Club could give freshman  
values and friendships. The freshmen could show their true  
personalities and dreams in a family environment.<br /><br />

Aggie Fish Club started in the fall of 1992 with two  
directors, 20 counselors and 40 fish. They picked the "cream  
of the crop" right from the start. The first buddy huddles  
were called "jawbreakers", and the counselors enjoyed taking  
the freshman on scavenger hunts, going on roadtrips, and  
have good, old-fashioned fun. Student Activities gave AFC  
$500, but they needed more money to run the organization.  
Freshmen were required to pay dues, which helped, but the  
directors paid at least $6,000 out of their own pockets  
during those two years to get AFC on its feet. This figure  
was so ridiculous because the directors didn't know how to  
<img style="margin-right:20px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px;float:left; border:7px groove gray; width:420px; height:240px;" alt="" src="History_Files/Spring_Retreat.jpg" />
budget their money, and they constantly were asking for  
money from their parents. There was a lack of structure, and  
operation of the organization took its toll on the  
directors. In the spring of 1993, Casey burned out on Aggie  
Fish Club and stepped down as director. Jason took over for  
the last few months of the semester, and a lot of evaluation  
was done because many changes needed to be made. Directors  
Amy Klinkovsky '95 and Christie Barrett '95 saw that these  
changes were made, and they helped turn AFC into what it  
needed to become. They polished the fine edges by making the  
organization more structured, serious, and mature.<br /><br />

Aggie Fish Club has made a name for itself on and around  
campus that others can see. It has blossomed into an  
organization that produces friends and leaders that are  
making changes. Members pride themselves on balanced  
involvement, active leadership, integrity, maturity,  
passion, and service, all traits that an effective leader  
should exemplify.<br /><br /> <div style="text-align:center">

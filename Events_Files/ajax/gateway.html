    A conference planned by DOC for high school students that wouldnâ€™t normally go to college, Gateway shows the students that college is a reachable and reasonable opportunity for them.   AFC leads the students all of campus, taking them on a tour, feeding them at Sbisa, and teaching them all about Aggie traditions!
